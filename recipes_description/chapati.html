        <h2>How to Make Chapati</h2>
        <p>You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

        <h2>Chapati Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Chapati Step-By-Step</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MMix flour and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead several times. Divide into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into a very thin round using a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each dough round on griddle until dough bubbles and blisters appear, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the other side.</li>
        </ul>>
