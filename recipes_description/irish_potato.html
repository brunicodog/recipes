        <h2>How to Make Irish Potato</h2>
        <p>You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

        <h2>Irish Potato Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Irish Potato Step-By-Step</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cover potatoes with water in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer on medium-high heat until center of potatoes are tender when pricked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain, return potatoes to the pot, and allow to completely dry out over the remaining residual heat.</li>
            <li>Mash with a potato masher until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place warm mashed potato in a medium bowl. Stir in flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix lightly until dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead dough lightly on a well-floured surface. The dough will be sticky. Use a floured rolling pin to flatten into a 9-inch circle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into quarters using a floured knife.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little flour into the bottom of a skillet and cook farls until evenly browned, about 3 minutes on each side. Season with a little salt and serve straight away.</li>
        </ul>>
